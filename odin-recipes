            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tomahawk ribeye</li>
                <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
                <li>1-2 sprigs fresh rosemary</li>
                <li>salt and pepper</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove your steak from the refrigerator and allow it to warm up slightly to room temperature for about an hour.</li>
                <li>Season steak generously with salt and pepper. Insert a reliable leave-in thermometer into the thickest portion of the steak.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 225 fahrenheit. Place the cast iron pan in the oven when ready.</li>
                <li>Let the steak cook for about 45 minutes or until the internal temperature reaches about 130. Then let the steak rest a few minutes before searing.</li>
                <li>Turn the stove temperature to high and then place the cooked steak directly onto the skillet, flipping every 30 seconds for about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the steak from the iron pan and top with butter and rosemary. Slice and serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
